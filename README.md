### Overview

**Valutron** is an experimental programming language. The name stands for
"Functional Language Built Upon The Lambda Calculus with Object-Oriented
Characteristics." The primary source of inspiration in the design of Valutron
is Scheme and Common Lisp; indeed, Valutron's design is directly based upon
that of John McCarthy's Lisp 1.5 and of Scheme. Additional inspiration has been
drawn from Apple Dylan, Smalltalk, and perhaps others.
